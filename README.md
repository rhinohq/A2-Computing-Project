# A2-Computing-Project
This is the repo for my AQA A2 Computing Project, a Lua learning website.

It is called Code College and is aimed at young kids and students to learn to program.

It features numerous exercises that are completed by the user. These coding tasks are interpreted on the server and displayed in a console in the browser using AJAX.
