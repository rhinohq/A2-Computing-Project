Introducing If Statements

[ExDescription]
In many programming languages, including Lua, we use if statements to tell the computer what we want to happen next, depending on a certain condition. In the editor, there is an example of an if statement.

In the example, change the word "condition" to 'num < 15'.

[ExCodeTemplate]
num = 5 * 2\r\rif condition then\r\tprint("num is less than 15.")\rend

[ExAppendCode]

[ExMarkScheme]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<MarkScheme>
	<Output>num is less than 15.</Output>
	<ControlStructures>
		<ControlStructure StructType="IF">num &#60; 15</ControlStructure>
	</ControlStructures>
</MarkScheme>
